# hast-to-hyperscript

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use [`hast-util-to-jsx-runtime`][hast-util-to-jsx-runtime] instead,
which is much better.

Legacy [documentation for this package](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast-to-hyperscript/tree/6f6e746)
is still available in Git.
